# Rust Important Links 

Site | What 
:--: | :--:
[`Rust Plaayground (Fiddle)`](https://play.rust-lang.org/) | Rust fiddle with many represenations for understanding, looks more like the standard library.

# Notez 

1. `Vectors` - Arrays that can change size 
   1. `arrays` - Fixed Length
   2. `array` is faster than a `vector`
2. Since variables are by default immutable, they are called `bindings`
   1. `let` is used to create a variable   
   2. `let mut` is used to create a mutable variable
   3. `let mut x = 5` - creates a mutable variable `x` with value `5`
3. `impl` - Implementation which is for structs
